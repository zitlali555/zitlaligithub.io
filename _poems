title: "At the Toilet"
collection: "Quiet Things"
---

I want to throw up all my insecurities  
Throw it all up into the toilet
I want to throw up all that you made me feel
Throw it all up into the toilet
I went to throw up all my worries
Throw it all up into the toilet
I want to throw up all my kept in emotions
Throw it all up in the toilet
I want to throw up all my mistakes
Throw it all up to the toilet
I want to throw up the past
Throw it all up into the toilet 
I want to throw up my sins 
Throw it all up into the toilet

Throwing it all up will hurt. It will be painful to go through

But I'm willing to go through it if it means I'll get closer to you.
